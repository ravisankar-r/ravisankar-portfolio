# Hi, I'm ravisankar 👋  

I build things that live on phones, servers, and everywhere in between.  
As a generalist programmer, I connect dots across stacks: mobile (Swift/Kotlin), backend (Python/Node), and the delightful chaos where they meet—debugging everything from race conditions to 'works on my machine' syndromes.  

### What I Do  
📱 **Mobile**:  iOS (Swift/ Objectice-C), Android (Kotlin), and cross-platform (Flutter).  
🛠️ **Backend**: Django | Node.js | PostgreSQL/MongoDB.  

### My Story  
I’ve spent 15+ years solving problems across the stack—from crafting mobile apps (iOS/Android) and scalable backends (Python/Node.js) to ensuring reliability as an automation test engineer. My career thrives at the intersection of building things right and making sure they stay right, with a side of curiosity for how technology shapes everyday experiences. 

### Beyond Code  
🌶️ Cooking is my creative outlet—I love exploring new cuisines and perfecting spicy dishes.
📚 History books fuel my curiosity, while movies are my escape.
